## Summary: 

There does not seem to be any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. The percentage of 5 star reviews in the Vine program is actually 10% lower than the Non-Vine reviews. 
An additional analysis that could be done would be to look at the percentages for each star rating for the two sample sets to see if one of them skews futher negative.
